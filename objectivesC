C - Hello, World

*General
Why C programming is awesome
Who invented C
Who are Dennis Ritchie, Brian Kernighan and Linus Torvalds
What happens when you type gcc main.c = will compiler and create an executable file called a.out.

What is an entry point = a location in code where a tranfer of program control (execution) occurs.
What is main = is function/a predefined keyword or function in c.
How to print text using printf, puts and putchar = for printf use ("%");brackets/doublequot/percent/semicolong :more expensive 
                                                 = for puts use ("\n");moves the cursor to next line/les expensive printing a string
                                                 = for putchar use ( );write the character to stdout
How to get the size of a specific type using the unary operator sizeof = sizeof(char)=1bytes

How to compile using gcc = gcc filename.c
                         = ./a.out
What is the default program name when compiling with gcc =gcc assumes
What is the official C coding style and how to check your code with betty-style =  betty filename .Use C99 standard
  Do not use tabs, use spaces instead
  Use 4 spaces per indent level
  Use 1 space between keyword and opening bracket
          /* OK */
          if (condition)
          while (condition)
          for (init; condition; step)
          do {} while (condition)

                                  /* Wrong */
                                  if(condition)
                                  while(condition)
                                  for(init;condition;step)
                                  do {} while(condition)
How to find the right header to include in your source code when using a standard library function = man 3 function_name_here
How does the main function influence the return value of the program = return 0;
                                                                     = int main() {
                                                                     ....
                                                                     return 0;
                                                                     }



C - Variables, if, else, while
*General
What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them = is a mathematical function that takes two operands and performs a calculation on them
      Addition (+)
      Subtraction (-)
      Multiplication (×)/(*)
      Division (÷)/(/)
What are the logical operators (sometimes called boolean operators) and how to use them = and, or, and not.
      For example, x > 0 and x < 10 is true only if x is greater than 0 and at the same time, x is less than 10. How would you describe this in words? You would say that x is between 0 and 10, not including the endpints.
      n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0 is true if either of the conditions is true, that is, if the number is divisible by 2 or divisible by 3. In this case, one, or the other, or both of the parts has to be true for the result to be true.
      Finally, the not operator negates a boolean expression, so not  x > y is true if x > y is false, that is, if x is less than or equal to y.
What the the relational operators and how to use them = is a programing language construct or operator that tests or difines some kind of relation between two entities.
      exm :equality (e.g., 5 = 5) and inequalities (e.g., 4 ≥ 3).
What values are considered TRUE and FALSE in C = value of true ( 1 ) or false ( 0 ) as a result.
What are the boolean operators and how to use them = used for storing logical values.And use for integers for boolean testing
                  Operator
            Meaning
            A > B
            True ( 1 ) if A is greater than B, false ( 0 ) otherwise
            A < B
            True ( 1 ) if A is less than B, false ( 0 ) otherwise
            A >= B
            True ( 1 ) if A is greater than or equal to B, false ( 0 ) otherwise
            A <= B
            True ( 1 ) if A is less than or equal to B, false ( 0 ) otherwise
            A = = B
            True ( 1 ) if A is exactly equal to B, false ( 0 ) otherwise
            A != B
            True ( 1 ) if A is not equal to B, false ( 0 ) otherwise

How to use the if, if ... else statements = 
            Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
            Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
            Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
            Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
